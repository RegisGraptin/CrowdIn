CrowdIn is a decentralized crowdfunding platform designed to foster innovation and incentivize project development within the NeoX ecosystem. By leveraging blockchain technology, CrowdIn ensures transparency, security, and efficiency in fundraising, empowering project creators and contributors alike.


# Key Features

## Campaign Creation

Project creators can launch a crowdfunding campaign with the following parameters:

- Funding Goal: The target amount to be raised.
- Deadline: The end date for the campaign.
- Milestones: A set of predefined stages with descriptions, target funds, and deadlines.

## Contribution Mechanism

Contributions are currently limited to the platform's native token. Funds are locked in the contract and released upon milestone completion. Milestone approval requires contributor consensus (e.g., through voting or quorum mechanisms).
